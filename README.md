Created By Sophie Zheng and Paige McDougall

### Description:
This project is a Donkey Kong-inspired game implemented in C, utilizing PS2 keyboard input and VGA display. The game features a platform-type gameplay where the player controls Mario through various levels while navigating obstacles and rolling barrels. The objective is to guide Mario to a flag located at the end of each level, all while striving to achieve the fastest completion time and jumping over as many barrels as possible.

### Game Features:
- **Main Menu**: Upon launching the game, players are greeted with a main menu where they can choose to view game instructions or start playing.
- **Multiple Levels**: The game consists of multiple levels, each introducing new challenges and obstacles. The first level serves as a tutorial to familiarize players with the controls.
- **Pause Menu**: Players can pause the game at any time, accessing a pause menu that allows them to return to the main menu, resume the game, or restart the current level.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points based on their performance, including completion time and the number of barrels jumped over. A live score count is displayed in the top left corner of the game screen, and a scoreboard updates after each round on the main menu.

### Game Controls:
- **PS2 Keyboard**: Players use the PS2 keyboard to control Mario and navigate through different scenes. On-screen prompts provide guidance on which keys correspond to specific actions, as controls may vary from level to level.
